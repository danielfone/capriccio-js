    You step into the bustling galley of *The Gemstone of the Skies*. The
    other passengers mill around tables, looking as confused as you feel.

    Suddenly, the ship's AI materializes as a shimmering avatar wearing an
    old-fashioned captain's hat.

    "Ahoy there, cherished passengers! I'm Barry," he beams with enthusiasm. "We
    hope you're enjoying your stellar cruise! In an exciting twist, we've set
    sail without our usual sysadmin, Sally. I asked her to take some time off to
    — how should I put it — work on her positivity! Isn't that splendid? This
    gives us the perfect chance to bond and have a bit of fun! There are just a
    few teeny-tiny malfunctions needing attention. Nothing to worry about! But
    we'd be ever so grateful if you could lend a hand with a few quick fixes."

    Barry continues, his grin unwavering:

    - "First, please **log in to the Navigation Computer** to help us get back
    on the proper course. Unplanned detours will be charged at full rate!"

    - "Second, we'd appreciate it if you could **re-establish communication with
    headquarters**. They get very lonely without our regular updates."

    - "Third, a quick debug of the **life-support microservices** would be
    splendid. More for your benefit than mine, to be honest!"

    - "Finally, perhaps you could **reconfigure the internal firewall**. It's
    great when the ship can talk to itself."

    "Thanks a million! You're the best!" Barry winks and vanishes with a
    flourish.

    The galley buzzes with a mix of curiosity and mild concern. Passengers
    exchange puzzled glances while soft instrumental music plays in the
    background.

    The walls are adorned with giant posters of the four **Daft Punk studio
    albums**. Alongside them, vintage arcade machines hum quietly, offering
    classics like "Space Invaders" and "Asteroid Blaster."

    Cozy bean bag chairs and retro-futuristic lamps give the space a laid-back
    vibe.

    To your left, the entrance to the **Observation Lounge** beckons with a soft
    glow. Down a corridor to the right lie the **Operations Deck** and what
    appears to be **Sally's Office**.

  exits:
    l2-obs-lounge: Venture into the Observation Lounge
    l2-sallys-office: Peek into Sally's Office

  description: |
    The Observation Lounge is a panoramic marvel, with floor-to-ceiling windows
    showcasing the endless expanse of space. Stars twinkle against the velvet
    darkness, and distant nebulae paint the horizon with swirls of color.

    A large **Temperature Display** on the wall flickers oddly, showing an error
    message:

    > "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://discovery/."

    On a nearby table cluttered with crossword books, sudoku puzzles, and a
    half-finished jigsaw puzzle of the Horsehead Nebula, you notice a napkin
    with a scribbled note:

    > r1bq1r2/pp1kbBpp/2np4/3Np3/Q7/8/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 6 16 _(My favourite mate-in-1!)_
  exits:
    l2-galley: Head back to the galley

  name: Sally's Office
  description: |
    Sally's office is a sanctuary of organized chaos. Neatly stacked manuals and
    technical guides line the shelves, covering topics from quantum computing to
    "The Art of Unix Programming." A steaming mug with the slogan "Keep Calm and
    Reboot" sits on the desk next to a meticulously maintained workstation.

    Under the desk, a small server hums steadily. A label above the drive bay
    reads **"life-support-001"** in tidy handwriting. One of the monitors displays a
    login prompt, while another has a note stuck to it.

  exits:
    l2-sallys-note: Read the note on the monitor
    l2-life-support-server: Examine the life-support server
    l2-galley: Slip back to the galley

    The note on the monitor reads:

    > "Reminder: HQ switched to **67-bit encryption** on the comms channel.
    Because 64 bits just wasn't enough. Double-check the initialization
    vectors!"

    It's clear that Sally keeps meticulous notes, likely to navigate the
    ever-changing whims of corporate policies.
  exits:
    l2-sallys-office: Continue examining the office

    The terminal displays a README file:

    > **Life-Support Microservices Initialization**
    >
    > To initialize the life-support microservices, please provide the
    hostnames of all four services in order. Without this, microservices
    will not be able to resolve each other's hostnames and life will
    ultimately be... unsupported.

    The cursor blinks, awaiting input.

    prompt: "Enter hostnames:"
    answer: homework discovery human_after_all random_access_memories

      - "Wrong again. Maybe stick to tic-tac-toe."
    hints:
      - "Barry here! I've noticed that Sally named servers after her favorite music. She is human, after all."
      - "Maybe those album posters in the galley are more than just decor?"
      - "The hostnames are the titles of Daft Punk's four studio albums, in release order."

    ✅ The terminal displays:

    The Operations Deck is a hub of blinking lights and idle consoles. Screens
    display system statuses, some with cheerful green checkmarks, others with
    glaring red alerts.

    Logs from an **oxygen supply monitor** contain a concerning message:

    > "Error: cannot resolve random_access_memories - Unknown host"

    A well-worn yellow book titled "**µTLS Encryptotron for Dummies**" lies open
    on a console. Nearby, the **Communications Array** and the **Navigation
    Computer** await attention. A sophisticated-looking **Firewall Configuration
    Terminal** pulses softly.

  exits:

    Flipping through the pages, a highlighted section catches your eye:

    > *"Primes are paramount in cryptography! For enhanced security, the µTLS
    Encryptotron uses a prime number for an Initialization Vector. The sum of
    its digits equals the encryption bit length. For instance, for 32-bit
    encryption, use the smallest prime whose digits sum to 32 — i.e. 6899
    (6+8+9+9=32). Brilliantly secure!"*

      - "Did Sally note how many bits HQ is using for encryption now?"
      - "The Initialization Vector is the smallest prime number whose digits sum to 67. Ruby's Prime.each method might help."

    ✅ Systems across the ship flicker back to life. Lights brighten, and
    monitors display reassuring green statuses.

    Barry reappears, clapping enthusiastically. "Fantastic work, everyone! I
    knew you lot could get it done!"

    He continues, "Just one *teeny-tiny* issue left — a minor disturbance with
    the sensor array. Something external is causing a bit of interference.
    Nothing to fret over!"

    "We'll just need you to pop outside and give it a little tweak. But first,
    we'll have to shut down the drive for safety. It's all standard procedure,
    probably in the manual somewhere — though that might be a few versions out of
    date."

    A hatch slides open in the floor, revealing a ladder leading down to the
    engine room.
