#
# Level 4: The exterior of the ship.
#
# This level is about exploring the exterior of the ship. The player will need
# to navigate around the ship to reach the sensor array. The player can move in
# four directions: port, starboard, forward, and aft. It's never explicitly
# stated that the ship is round, but as the player moves to the left or right,
# they will swap between the dorsal and ventral sides of the ship. The player
# can see the sun from the dorsal side of the ship, and jupiter from the ventral
# side.
#
# The player will need to navigate around the ship to reach the sensor array.
#
# p - port, s - starboard, d - dorsal, v - ventral
#
# Once they get to the sensor array, they need to find the 'fundamental frequency'
# of the artefacts phase harmonics. The player can find the frequency by reading
# the sonic screwdriver terminals. These will be a base64 encoded .wav file and a
# PNG of a sine wave. They player can use one of a number of techniques to determine
# the frequency from the PNG graph or the WAV file. The answer is 440Hz.

    You step out of the airlock into the vastness of space. The stars shine
    brilliantly against the infinite black, and the gentle curve of *The
    Gemstone of the Skies* stretches out before you.

    Barry's voice comes through your helmet comms, as enthusiastic as ever.
    "Isn't it breathtaking? A perfect evening for a spacewalk! Now, we just need
    you to locate the **sensor array** and give it a little tweak. Easy as pie!"

    He adds, "Remember, safety first! But also, fun first!"

  exits:
    l4-d-aft: Carefully pull yourself along the hull

- id: l4-d-aft
  name: Aft Section
  description: |
    You find yourself on the ship's aft section. The hull beneath your feet is
    smooth, with occasional protrusions housing various instruments. Above you,
    the **Sun** glows faintly, a tiny but brilliant point of light.

    Glancing around, you see no sign of the sensor array here. The vastness of
    space surrounds you, and the ship stretches ahead.

  description: |
    On the ship's aft, you feel a slight disorientation as you adjust your
    perspective. In the distance, **Jupiter** dominates the starfield, its
    swirling storms faintly visible.

    The sensor array isn't located here, but the view is spectacular.

  description: |
    This area is relatively featureless, with only essential maintenance panels
    dotting the hull.

    There's no sign of the sensor array here.

# The first midships of the ship

- id: l4-d-mid1
  name: Amidships
  description: |
    You reach the midship area. The ship's structure widens here, and you can
    see various equipment mounted along the hull.

    The Sun is overhead, guiding your path. Still, the sensor array
    eludes you.

    The sensor array isn't here, but you sense you're getting closer.

# The second midships of the ship

- id: l4-d-mid2
  name: Amidships
  description: |
    You reach a section where the ship's design becomes more complex. Arrays of
    panels and conduits suggest critical systems are nearby.

    You can still make out the Sun, a distant but comforting presence.

    You arrive at the starboard wing, which extends gracefully from the main
    body of the ship. Embedded along its edge is the **sensor array**, a series
    of delicate instruments and antennae glowing faintly.

# The fore of the ship

- id: l4-d-bow
  name: The bow of the ship
  description: |
    The bow of the ship is a sleek, pointed structure that extends into the
    void. The sensor array isn't here, but the view is vertigo-inducing.

    The Sun is visible high above, too faint to cast any shadows.

# The highly sensitive  sensor array has been overwhelmed by some an extrasolar radiation source

  name: Sensor Array Interface
  description: |
    Lights flicker, and a small display activates, showing erratic readings and
    waveforms.

    Barry chimes in, "Seems the sensor array is being overwhelmed by some pesky
    external interference! I'm detecting some unstable tachyons, perhaps causing
    quantum rifts in space-time.

    If we can identify the **frequency** of the interference, we can
    calibrate the array to filter it out."

    The interface awaits your input.

    prompt: "Enter frequency (Hz):"

    errors:
      - "Incorrect frequency. Did you skip music class?"
      - "Nope. Maybe try tuning in better."
    hints:
      - "Barry here! Looks like the sonic screwdriver terminals are outputting binary data that's base64-encoded."
      - "I think I see a clue to the file type in the first few bytes of each file."
      - "You should have a visual and audio representation of the frequency. There are many approaches to working out the frequency. You're on your own from here!"

    âœ… The sensor array lights stabilize, and readings return to normal. Barry's
    voice fills your helmet with delight. "Fantastic! You've done it! The
    interference is gone, and the sensor array is back online. I knew you had it
    in you!"

    "Now, with everything shipshape, how about we head back inside? A
    celebratory drink sounds perfect, doesn't it?"

    He adds, "Oh, and before we get too cozy, we'll need to restart the ship's drive.
    But no rush! Maybe grab your **magboots** from your locker when you're back
    onboard."
