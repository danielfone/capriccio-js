# Level 5: Back to the cabin

# They plyaer has done the hard part now. Ostensibly, they just need to restart
# the engine before they can celebrate. In practice though, the player's
# character is going to get distracted and have a drink. They'll then end up in
# the time loop perhaps realising that their removal of the artefact didn't
# really solve the problem.

    Finding your way back to the airlock is much faster now that you know the
    way. You cycle the airlock and start spinning down the corridors rather
    recklessly. Like a school kid on a shopping trolley, the novelty of gliding
    has somewhat gone to your head.

    Somehow, the cabin seems smaller when you're floating in it. The lack of
    gravity adds a new dimension to the familiar space.

    Your locker hangs above you. A crumpled post-it note tumbles lazily in the
    air. It must have fallen behind the locker at some point. Written on it, in
    your unmistakable handwriting, are the numbers:

    > **1234**

    You wonder what it could be for.

    The keypad glows unenthusiastically, awaiting your input.

    prompt: "Enter 4-digit locker code:"
    answer: ""

    errors:
      - "Access denied. Wrong password."
      - "Incorrect. Maybe think harder."

      - "Really?"

    You open your locker. The magboots are tumbling slowly behind a half-empty
    bottle of **Ol' Janx Spirit**. It occurs to you that you've never tried to
    mix a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster on the float before.

    Now that the emergency is over, you feel a little more relaxed. You could use a drink.

    Surely the drive can wait a little longer.
  exits:
    l5-a-drink: Against your better judgment, mix a drink

  description: |
    You mix the **Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster** as if you've done it a thousand
    times before. You drink it... carefully.

    It feels, as they say, like having your brains smashed out by a slice of
    lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.

    You feel better now, more confident, more alive. You consider looking for
    the others to celebrate your success. But first...

  exits:
    a-hazy-return: "Just one more drinkâ€¦"
