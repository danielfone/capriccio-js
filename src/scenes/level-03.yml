    You descend the ladder into the dimly lit engine room. The hum of the ship's
    drive surrounds you.

    Barry's holographic avatar pops up beside you, grinning ear to ear. "Welcome
    to the heart of the ship! Isn't it thrilling down here? Now, we'll need to
    safely shut down the drive before your little spacewalk. I tried to shut
    it down myself, but it looks like the telemetry processor is feeling a bit
    under the weather! If you could just manually process the telemetry data, we
    can shut down the drive safely. Easy peasy!"

  exits:
    l3-engineering-room: Look around the engineering room

    The engineering room is a labyrinth of pipes, valves, and flickering
    consoles. The air smells faintly of ozone. Overhead, cables
    crisscross like metallic vines.

    Against one wall, a hefty **toolbox** sits invitingly, its drawers slightly
    ajar. On the opposite side, a dusty terminal displays a blinking cursor,
    indicating a **telnet server** awaiting input.
  exits:
    l3-toolbox: Investigate the toolbox
    l3-telnet-server: Approach the terminal

- id: l3-toolbox
  name: Engineering Toolbox
  description: |
    You open the hefty toolbox to find an eclectic assortment of gadgets:

    - A **sonic screwdriver**, its sleek design pulsing with a faint blue light.
    - A vintage **BlackBerry** device labeled "Maintenance" in fading letters.
    - A small, slightly dented **hammer** that looks well-used.

  exits:
    l3-blackberry: Examine the BlackBerry device
    l3-engineering-room: Close the toolbox

- id: l3-blackberry
  name: Maintenance BlackBerry
  description: |
    The BlackBerry's screen flickers to life with a tap. Navigating its archaic
    interface, the most recently updated file is **core_manifold/telemetry/processor**

    Opening the file, you're greeted with a jumble of code:

    ```
    }n?:y??}0==1%)n+)2**j_ot.l*5((trqs.elif|n|{?tna.]4-,4[|l|{pam.)' '(hcae.<$stup
    ```

    Other files are similarly corrupted, filled with nonsensical characters and symbols.
  exits:
    l3-engineering-room: Place the BlackBerry back

- id: l3-telnet-server
  name: Engineering Terminal
  description: |
    The terminal screen glows with lines of code and error messages. A prominent message reads:

    > Warning: Core manifold telemetry processor corrupted. Expected format /[yn]+/
    >
    > Unprocessed telemetry buffer: 03 15 08 14 07 13

    The terminal awaits your input.

  lock:
    prompt: "Enter processed telemetry data:"
    answer: "y n y n n y"
    opens: l3-out-the-airlock
    errors:
      - "Incorrect input. Did you misread the data?"
      - "Wrong again. Maybe engineering isn't your forte?"
    hints:
      - "Barry here! That script on the BlackBerry looks like some strangely corrupted Ruby code to me."
      - "Have you looked at it from all angles?"
      - "Try reversing the code, fixing the 3 substitutions, then passing numbers above as STDIN to the script. The script should output `y` or `n` for each number."
  exits:
    l3-engineering-room: Step back from the terminal

- id: l3-out-the-airlock
  name: Airlock Entrance
  description: |
    âœ… The drive winds down with a low hum, and your stomach lurches as the
    ship's thrust gravity fades away. You float gently off the floor,
    weightless.

    Barry materializes, standing on the floor, oblivious to the loss of gravity.
    "Marvelous job! The drive is now safely offline. Time for a little stroll
    among the stars! Isn't this exciting?"

    He gestures toward the **sonic screwdriver** you found earlier. "You'll want
    to take that nifty gadget with you. Perfect for all sorts of fixes!"

    A nearby hatch slides open, revealing the airlock chamber bathed in a soft
    blue light.
  exits:
    l4-spacewalk: Enter the airlock and prepare for your spacewalk on LEVEL 4
